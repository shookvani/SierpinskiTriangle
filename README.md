# SierpinskiTriangle
This is a program that uses Java to draw the Sierpinski Triangle with user input for the order. People are able to visualize fractals better, a math concept that isn't really grasped easily. The triangle is self-similar, which means that it is similar to the smaller parts of itself. 
This is so that it can be easy to visualize fractals. In the future, we can use this program to look at the further applications in physics, specifically with sensors (mid-infrared) and to look at the idea of nanostructures. We can also think about special effects (think graphic design: the repeating patterns) in movies and other graphics. 

Other applications of fractals include: fractal cities (cities whose populations grow in fractals), fractal medicine (medical diagnoses because bloodcells grow in fractal patterns), art, image resolution, and more. 

Based on the assignment from the "Recursive Graphics" from Princeton University's COS 126 (Spring, 2019) class.
